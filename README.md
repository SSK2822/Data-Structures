# Data-Structures
 
 This is my repository for course CS3334 Data Structes at City University of Hong Kong. All the problem sets are uploaded and taken from ACM website. Use of ACM (http://acm.cs.cityu.edu.hk/oj2/) as the online judgement system for the course. The solutions use wide variety of data structures and have mostly passed all the mentioned problem sets in OJ. 
The main language of programming is C++ and I used XCode as my primary IDE for the purpose of solving problem sets.
